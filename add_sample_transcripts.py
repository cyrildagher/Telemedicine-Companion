Patient: I've been having this persistent dry cough for about a week now, and some chest discomfort.

Doctor: I see. Any fever or other symptoms?

Patient: No fever, but I do feel a bit short of breath sometimes, especially when I'm active.

Doctor: Have you been taking any medications for this?

Patient: No, I haven't taken anything yet. I wanted to see you first.

Doctor: That's good. Let me listen to your chest and check your oxygen levels.

[Physical examination performed]

Doctor: Your oxygen saturation is good at 98%. I can hear some mild congestion in your chest. I'd like to order a chest x-ray to rule out any underlying issues.

Patient: That sounds good. What about treatment?

Doctor: I'll prescribe azithromycin 500mg once daily for 5 days. Also, make sure to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. Follow up with me in a week if your symptoms don't improve or if they get worse.

Patient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to take the medication as prescribed.

Doctor: You're welcome. Take care and get well soon."""
